				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had the opportunity to be with Amish for a few hours this past week. I&#8217;ve seen things on TV about them, I&#8217;ve read about them; I&#8217;ve always been curious.<br />
They were a father and mother of 6 kids, 4 girls and 2 boys.<br />
I really had no expectations, but by the end of the couple hours, I would call us friends. He had questions for me, I had questions for them and we spent most of the time just chatting away. We sang a couple hymns that we both knew and they sang one that I didn&#8217;t. I found out that they don&#8217;t waste anything. They&#8217;re not afraid to ask for thing that others would throw out. The mom used to be an Amish school teacher and now their 2 oldest daughters are. He told me that he respects me for not quitting and raising my boys to be well behaved and that I make sure we get to church as much as we can. I told him that I respect him raising his family a step farther away from Satan&#8217;s temptations. He was sure to remind me that Satan is everywhere, and that there are still temptations.<br />
If given the opportunity, I&#8217;d love to spend some more time with them. We may not have the same title on earth, but we&#8217;ll be in Heaven together, and that makes us family in Christ.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday after school, 3 boys showed up. One was a friend that Three went trick or treating with and the other 2 were new. Three had asked that morning whether his friend (we&#8217;ll call him Brandon) could stay the night. I said sure. None of these 3 were Brandon.<br />
After an hour or so, the one mother of the child I knew came over personally and made sure that he was welcome there. She also made arrangements to pick him up at a certain time the next day. We chatted for a while, I showed her some recent things (that will become other blog posts), and she left.<br />
The other 2 boys, said that they checked it with parents and yes they could stay.<br />
So, I fed the 4 boys a snack, then dinner, then breakfast the next morning and then lunch. I was in the middle of throwing something together for tomorrow&#8217;s pot luck at church when the mother came to collect her son. We chatted again and then she left.<br />
Three said that the other 2 wanted to spend another night. I told him that we have church in the morning. He said they want to come.<br />
So I fed them a snack, I just fed them dinner again and now they&#8217;re starting to settle down and make their beds on cushionsÂ and the air mattress. They&#8217;ve been playing great all day.<br />
The thing that surprises me, is that I don&#8217;t know these other 2 boys&#8230; well, before yesterday. I haven&#8217;t met any of their parents. I haven&#8217;t even talked on the phone with them. When I suggested they run home quick and pick up some fresh clothes, they did. I was thinking that if it wasn&#8217;t ok for them to spend another night, when they popped home, their parents would notice.<br />
I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m old fashioned, but before my child goes somewhere, I meet the parents, I see for myself where he is going and all the details are discussed. I kinda feel bad for these boys. I wonder if they WANT to go home?<br />
So I&#8217;ll have 4 boys to take to church tomorrow. (One is away fixing a car making some needed money). They seem like good kids. I never know how God will use me to reach people. These boys will go to church for the first time tomorrow. We&#8217;ll see how it goes.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In balancing my checkbook tonight preparing to go grocery shopping tomorrow to buy this weeks groceries, I logged onto my bank&#8217;s online site and found that my balance was $0. I didn&#8217;t understand how I could get to <em>exactly</em> $0.00. Before my last transaction, I had $40.34. My last transaction, a trip to Walmart (for which I have the receipt, since I save my receipts) for 21 items for &#8211; insert drum roll &#8211; $40.34. <em><strong>Exactly</strong></em> $40.34! So on the one hand, it means I won&#8217;t be grocery shopping tomorrow morning, on the other hand, I think I&#8217;m lucky enough to win the lottery. There is no way in a million years I could have planned that. I went into Walmart, picked out 21 items and the cost of them, with tax, equaled the exact amount that I have in my checking account. If it had been even 1 more penny, the debit (or check) would have bounced.<br />
If you know the same God I do, you&#8217;d say that it wasn&#8217;t &#8220;luck.&#8221; Actually, things as crazy as this happen quite a bit around here.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My bother Brice died on August 5th, 2002.</p>
<p>That is a moment that changed my life forever. I would like to think that it changed me for the better despite the actual event itself of losing a brother is one of the most terrible things that can happen to a person and to a family. God has taught me many things and my life has slowed down after that day. I make sure that each day my children know that I love them and my priorities for daily life are so different than before that day.</p>
<p>This morning I watched a video of Brice cooking Lobsters. The video is only months before he died. My mom had a company make the DVD from an old video tape. It has a few other clips of family members with Brice in them too.<br />
I was able to watch it without crying. I was able to smile and soak in the video and listen to Brice as he talked. I watched his face; I watched his movements. I remembered my brother. I miss my brother. That fact will never change. And the fact that I don&#8217;t go through a single day without thinking of him in some way will never change either. I still have dreams about him. I still mention him to my boys. I tell them how smart he was and how in some ways that they are like him. But I am at peace that he is gone. I do still cry. I&#8217;m crying as I type this now. Some day I will see him when I get to heaven. He&#8217;ll be waiting for me.Â But for now, it was nice to see him for those few minutes on that video and hear his voice.</p>
<p>I love you Brice and miss you everyday. Tell Grandma and Grandpa Hi. See you when I get there.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re on our last roll of toilet paper. Our phones were turned off and I promised the final $68 of the bill would be paid on Friday. Our internet was off and I paid $24 of the back pay to get it turned back on. We got another disconnection notice on our electricity bill for yesterday, so I wrote a bad check for $298.</p>
<p>I have 3 checking accounts: One has 6 cents, One has 25 cents, One has $98.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve sold the old school books on Ebay. I&#8217;ve kept the AC off to lower bills. I don&#8217;t know what else (beside selling my body) I can do to get more money. My parents are at the last of what they can give me and I feel so bad asking for more.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve given it to God. It&#8217;s not in my control. He&#8217;s going have to bail me out because there is no other options. My SSI deposit into my checking account is going to have to come this week. It has to or we will have everything shut off. So it will come because my God is great and He will take care of us.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two sent me thisÂ <a href="http://www.goodbyewarden.com/" target="_blank">LINK</a>Â and I&#8217;ve been reading a few of them here and there in between my regular internet musings. It has the &#8220;last words&#8221; of prisoners as they are being executed. Of all the things that they could say, the topics are either God or family. They don&#8217;t say things like, &#8220;I wish I could have golfed one more round&#8221; or &#8220;I would have liked to have gotten that certain job&#8221; they are saying the names of loved ones, they are telling family that they loved them and then they say that they will see their loved ones when they join them some day.<br />
It brings all of the recent stress and countless things that I bear on my shoulders to an easy focus of what is important: my God and my family. Those two points echo the exact words of the evangelist that spoke at our church last week. When all the busyness and chaos rush by us each day and it seems like the days just mimic the last one without a discernibleÂ difference, I need to bring my focus back to where it needs to be.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A stretching field of golden grass<br />
Golden, like a bell of brass<br />
Shrubs and bushes here and there<br />
Scattered as if were no care<br />
The bushes are of different heights<br />
Different colors, different mights<br />
Some are strong are some are weak<br />
Some are proud and some are meek<br />
Winds and storms do often come<br />
And break a branch of fragile ones<br />
And sometimes in the moonlight black<br />
Or maybe day is seen a sack<br />
Within the hands of tall a man<br />
Who comes and gathers what he can<br />
He brings them to the place he lives<br />
A very cautious look he gives<br />
For if the bush is small and thin<br />
The fireplace is where it&#8217;s in<br />
But if the wood is fine and thick<br />
He&#8217;ll make a sturdy walking stick<br />
Or sometimes if the mood is good<br />
He&#8217;ll take the little piece of wood<br />
And carve a gorgeous thing to place<br />
Upon his shelf and by his vase<br />
He keeps this field with bursting pride<br />
He watches out as days go by<br />
To see that only he will trim<br />
To make the bushes grow for him<br />
Oh, there are some who do stand tall<br />
And hardly need a trim at all<br />
But some are stray and tangled round<br />
And laying flat along the ground<br />
For these he gives a sigh of grief<br />
He knows that it has been a thief<br />
The bushes can ignore the tools<br />
Used by these unruly fools<br />
They think it&#8217;s easier to lay<br />
And not their springing roots obey<br />
Forever here they lay to rest<br />
He knows they could have been the best</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Standing here quietly<br />
Waiting in line<br />
Thousands in front of me<br />
Thousands behind</p>
<p>Just then I look over<br />
And see such a crowd<br />
Of crying sad people<br />
Theyâre wailing so loud</p>
<p>I tap on the shoulder<br />
Of him before me<br />
And ask why those people<br />
Are there that I see</p>
<p>With coldness and sorrow<br />
He tells me their fate<br />
Those are the people<br />
Who found out too late</p>
<p>Too late to be saved<br />
Too late to have life<br />
Theyâll now live forever<br />
In hell in their strife</p>
<p>Compassion within me<br />
I look at the crowd<br />
I now see their faces<br />
The meek and the proud</p>
<p>But wait, in the middle<br />
Oh no, could it be?<br />
A person I know<br />
I barely can see</p>
<p>He comes towards the edge<br />
And meets eye to eye<br />
A shiver comes over<br />
And I start to cry</p>
<p>My grandpa is standing there<br />
Tears in his eyes<br />
I cannot quite hear him<br />
But know he yells âwhy?â</p>
<p>I knew the truth<br />
And never told him<br />
I thought it too silly<br />
To tell him of sin</p>
<p>And now I see more<br />
My aunt and my friend<br />
My cousin, my brother<br />
Oh when will it end?</p>
<p>My eyes are now opened<br />
And I look to see<br />
The whole wailing crowd<br />
Is looking at me</p>
<p>I know every one<br />
And yet didnât tell<br />
These small yearning souls<br />
About God and Hell</p>
<p>What was I thinking?<br />
God sent them my way<br />
For them to be saved<br />
I didn&#8217;t obey</p>
<p>And now itâs too late<br />
Too late to go back<br />
And redo mistakes<br />
And fix what I&#8217;ve lacked</p>
<p>The thought burns within me<br />
And forever will<br />
As Iâll live in joy<br />
And theyâll die in Hell.</p>
