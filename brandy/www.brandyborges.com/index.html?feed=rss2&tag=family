				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I woke up Wednesday at 3:30 am. As of midnight last night (Friday night), I had slept a broken 4 1/2 hours total. My body feels hazy; when I turn my head I get dizzy and I can&#8217;t seem to stomach any food. But last night I was able to eat a few Ravioli&#8217;s from the casserole I made, and settle in at 3 am and drift off to wonderful sleep. I woke up so many times, but pushed the pain away and stayed so still in the darkness until my body relaxed and fell asleep again. I woke up this morning at 9. The sun was out and a cool breeze was coming through my window. I still feel&#8230; <em>off, b</em>ut I have a long day ahead and 6 hours is more sleep than the previous 2 nights and I&#8217;m thankful for every minute.<br />
Yesterday was&#8230;. eventful, frustrating and long. Two bit my head off for not going out of my way to force Three to his last basketball game of the season where Cede said he <em>MIGHT</em> show up. Three had already planned to have 3 of his friends from school sleep over. Cede usually remembers to call Three every month&#8230; sometimes every other month. He took time out of his schedule to visit him for 5 days last year. I&#8217;m not making him cancel plans with his friends at the last minute to see a person that doesn&#8217;t care about him in the least.<br />
I&#8217;m planning to go to the last game (he plays 2 today). I know I&#8217;ll be hurting for sitting through 1 game, but if your a <em>true</em> parent, you know that life isn&#8217;t about you.</p>
<p>I got up and made Three and his 3 friends french toast this morning. He&#8217;s happy and joking and beautiful. I look at him as I&#8217;m sure he looks at himself and wonder what is <em>so wrong</em> with him that Cede left him ( and me and his 2 brothers). What did he do to deserve such pain? I will make sure that I do everything in my power to help him be happy and ok with himself. He&#8217;s worth it to me. I&#8217;ll love him enough for 2 people, just like I do for his brothers. We&#8217;re ok. We&#8217;re more than ok, we&#8217;re great.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I didn&#8217;t feel like talking to people and going into explaining EVERYTHING that was going on. I stopped posting on FB, I stopped writing in here. I pretty much just withdrew.<br />
I&#8217;m allowed to do what I want. I&#8217;m allowed to be annoyed by people.</p>
<p>Everyone has things happen in their life that they cannot control. Everyone gets pissed, frustrated and fed-up. I&#8217;ll go back and fill in a few things.</p>
<p>Christmas was hard. For starters, I had no tree. I<em> LOVE</em> having a Christmas tree; I love putting up lights and stockings and I love sending Christmas cards. None of that happened this year. It was just beyond my control. Then, I asked not to be put in the same room as Mr. Right for the holidays. I asked for people to stand up for me and tell Mr. Right that he was wrong. I would imagine this would be a simple request since he thinks he&#8217;s a doctor and without knowing my symptoms, medication and details, he has told me that I am completely healthy and have nothing wrong with me. (and my kids didn&#8217;t inherit  my genetic syndrome either). It&#8217;s so funny how I duped the SSI system of the government &#8211; as if I can fake geneticists reports, doctors notes, blood-work and MRI results.<br />
So I just didn&#8217;t want to be next to someone who is an idiot. (&#8220;Idiot: <span class="oneClick-link">an</span> <span class="oneClick-link oneClick-available">utterly</span> <span class="oneClick-link oneClick-available">foolish</span> <span class="oneClick-link">or</span> <span class="oneClick-link oneClick-available">senseless</span> <span class="oneClick-link oneClick-available">person.&#8221;) Who could blame me? So there was no Christmas. It was a wonderful display of who is actually in my corner.</span></p>
<p><span class="oneClick-link oneClick-available">Then, I had my birthday. It&#8217;s really hard being 42 and having to live the life of a 79 yr old. I use a cane, I drive a motorized cart in Walmart. Do you know how hard it is to drive past old people shopping that are walking and lifting their groceries when I am half their age and cannot walk to the back of the store or lift a gallon of milk.</span></p>
<p>Then&#8230; just a few weeks ago I lost the ability to open a can with a can opener. On the EDS support groups, it&#8217;s a line that&#8217;s drawn in the sand. Well, I&#8217;m past the line and I now own a shiny, electric can opener.</p>
<p>Then, I started getting huge &#8220;loss of concentration&#8221; times. It&#8217;s hard enough being in bed 98% and not being able to read because my eyes feel the need to go crazy.<br />
I won&#8217;t go into details, but the last straw on the list was backing into a parking spot that already contained a car. I was going slow and did no damage, but how could I not have seen a whole car? I was feeling SO independent being able to drive for 10 to 15 minutes by myself and now I have nothing. I made the decision to not drive (at least until these episodes end) and my boys have had to pick up the 1 to 2 times a week that I did drive.</p>
<p>Then, I found out that I HAVE to see my doctor in Monroe, WI before he&#8217;ll prescribe me any more meds. He&#8217;s out of my HMO. I don&#8217;t have $400 to drop in cash for an appointment and my social worker refused to authorize the appointment. So now I&#8217;m in bed 100% of the time because I have <strong>no</strong> pain relief.</p>
<p>Then, the doctor that I saw to discuss my confusion (who had never met me before) told me that I&#8217;m depressed and that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m having these episodes. I told her that just because I have things in my life that I cannot control does not make me run off a cliff to end my life. Of course I have stress. Of course I have pain, health problems, money problems and I&#8217;m raising 3 kids on my own. That doesn&#8217;t mean I need to add another medication. Ask my boys, ask my church family, ask the friends I talk to on a daily basis&#8230;. they&#8217;ll tell you. So if I take depression meds, how would that change anything? Then I&#8217;ll be happy and thrilled to spend my life in bed?</p>
<p>I am so sick and tired of being labeled. I&#8217;m so tired of people asking me if I&#8217;m depressed. Go talk to my counselor that I see 2 x a month. I tell him everything. He&#8217;ll tell you I&#8217;m just fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;m done with my rant. I feel better &lt; sigh &gt;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think I remember being 17. I&#8217;m sure I felt invincible.<br />
Two turned 17 last month. I look at him and all I see is a smiling, little boy, curious to learn about everything. He&#8217;s growing up. I don&#8217;t know when it happened.<br />
He has everything, well, anything he needs. He works and also makes money from some things he doesn&#8217;t online. There is nothing I can buy him&#8230; I have no money. He knows and understands, but I feel bad that I can&#8217;t even celebrate his birthday by giving him a gift.<br />
So this year I&#8217;ve been watching the Northern Lights. They have sensors and instruments that predict it. Well, I had been following it and there was a prediction that they were going to be able to be seen in Eau Claire. So I surprised him, told him about it, showed him the app and the data, and we headed up north (2 hours).<br />
To make a long story short, we waited and never saw them. I was so disappointed. I just wanted to do something special for him.<br />
Someday I&#8217;ll give him something magnificent&#8230; something that isn&#8217;t money, but worth the world to him. Someday&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday after school, 3 boys showed up. One was a friend that Three went trick or treating with and the other 2 were new. Three had asked that morning whether his friend (we&#8217;ll call him Brandon) could stay the night. I said sure. None of these 3 were Brandon.<br />
After an hour or so, the one mother of the child I knew came over personally and made sure that he was welcome there. She also made arrangements to pick him up at a certain time the next day. We chatted for a while, I showed her some recent things (that will become other blog posts), and she left.<br />
The other 2 boys, said that they checked it with parents and yes they could stay.<br />
So, I fed the 4 boys a snack, then dinner, then breakfast the next morning and then lunch. I was in the middle of throwing something together for tomorrow&#8217;s pot luck at church when the mother came to collect her son. We chatted again and then she left.<br />
Three said that the other 2 wanted to spend another night. I told him that we have church in the morning. He said they want to come.<br />
So I fed them a snack, I just fed them dinner again and now they&#8217;re starting to settle down and make their beds on cushions and the air mattress. They&#8217;ve been playing great all day.<br />
The thing that surprises me, is that I don&#8217;t know these other 2 boys&#8230; well, before yesterday. I haven&#8217;t met any of their parents. I haven&#8217;t even talked on the phone with them. When I suggested they run home quick and pick up some fresh clothes, they did. I was thinking that if it wasn&#8217;t ok for them to spend another night, when they popped home, their parents would notice.<br />
I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m old fashioned, but before my child goes somewhere, I meet the parents, I see for myself where he is going and all the details are discussed. I kinda feel bad for these boys. I wonder if they WANT to go home?<br />
So I&#8217;ll have 4 boys to take to church tomorrow. (One is away fixing a car making some needed money). They seem like good kids. I never know how God will use me to reach people. These boys will go to church for the first time tomorrow. We&#8217;ll see how it goes.</p>

Two and I made the 3 hour trip there by 1:30 in the morning, packed until 4, and started to head here. We, by chance, ran into my dad at the gas station / restaurant where we stopped to get gas and my dad offered to buy us breakfast. We finished eating, got on the road and finally arrived here by 9 am. We left everything and went right to bed. By time I fell asleep, I had been awake for 28 hours.<br />
Today we cleaned and rearranged the garage to fit his car parts and tools. We&#8217;re now discussing how to add a room along side my trailer so that he&#8217;d have a room to stay in.<br />
It is not how I planned, but it&#8217;s nice to have all 3 under my roof again. They&#8217;ll always be my babies, no matter how old or big they get. It feels like we&#8217;re whole again&#8230; complete.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is so much that I want to do.<br />
My wall is all mudded and sanded in the living room and ready for the wanes-coating and paint, but I haven&#8217;t been able to do much in the last few days.<br />
My headaches are back and when I woke up this morning I forgot to make sure my hips were in their sockets and as I was walking to the bathroom, the left hip popped back into place and I haven&#8217;t been able to bear weight on it all day.<br />
I have food from the pantry I went to on Monday, but I can&#8217;t stand long enough to make anything.<br />
With my check on the first of the month, I paid all my bills, but I have no money left.<br />
It just seems like I can&#8217;t get ahead&#8230; I can&#8217;t accomplish anything&#8230; I can&#8217;t get one step forward.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m so lonely. I know that God will send the right one for me at the perfect time, but patience is not my strong suit.<br />
Maybe tomorrow will be better&#8230;.. just maybe.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My father-in-law died this week. I hear he died of an aneurysm. I&#8217;ve known him since 1999 &#8211; 16 years now. Cede texted One, and One texted me so that I could tell Two and Three. I was shaken, but not as much as I thought I&#8217;d be. Neither were the kids.<br />
Almost 3 years ago now, when Cede left, I went in person to my mother-in-law to let her know that Cede was having an affair and was not giving me any money for bills. I thought that I was close with her. We&#8217;ve never had a disagreement with her and never a single negative word was spoken back or forth. But as I was crying and telling her, she said, &#8220;I&#8217;m not getting involved.&#8221; I again, tried to explain to her that he had abandoned his children to be with another woman and he was NOT helping me with food or bills or anything. &#8220;I&#8217;m staying out of your life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m staying out&#8230;&#8221; My children are her ONLY grandchildren. Most of the time through the last 13 years, I had been the one bringing over the kids to see their grandparents. Cede was either working or in the garage working on some car and was too busy to think about the relationship between his children and his parents. I made sure they were invited to each birthday. I made sure they knew about each milestone and accomplishment. And now my MIL was telling me that she was refusing to be a part of her daughter-in-law and grandchildren&#8217;s lives. I don&#8217;t understand the reasoning behind that.<br />
So, for the last few years, the kids have not seen them except for maybe once or twice a year for a few hours when Cede decided to bring the kids to them. They&#8217;ve completely missed out on everything that has happened with their grandkids. They have become strangers. And when my children heard that their grandpa had died, they weren&#8217;t really sad. They didn&#8217;t know him anymore.</p>
<p>If a daughter-in-law comes up to me some day and tells me that one of my sons is cheating on her and is refusing to give her any money for the kids, I will NOT be &#8220;staying out.&#8221; I will be marching over to that son&#8217;s house and beating him. That behavior IS NOT acceptable. That behavior is NOT what I taught them about responsibility.</p>
<p>So now they only have their grandma left. And they will sadly keep living without her in their life. They lost her years ago. It was her decision&#8230;. very sad&#8230; life is too short.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had a very low &#8220;low&#8221; that ran for a couple weeks. I&#8217;m not sure if there is a trigger, or 30 triggers, but I spiral downward. And I&#8217;m back up, I am fine&#8230; I just had to slap myself in the face and convince myself this is not the way I live.</p>
<p>I get mad that we don&#8217;t have enough to pay the electricity / water bill and Two ends up paying it so we can keep our power and water.<br />
I get mad that I cannot be a whole me and be the mother I want.<br />
I get mad that I can mearly bend at the right angle and my back goes out putting me in bed for 4 days.<br />
I get mad that there are still health issues and even my new doctor isn&#8217;t &#8220;hearing&#8221; me.<br />
I think I do ok fighting at things when it&#8217;s only 1 or 2, but when a pile piles on my shoulders, I crumble.</p>
<p>Families were made to have 2 parents and Cede is off having a great, kid-free life. And yes, he&#8217;s unconsciously missing every conversation, every story, every milestone, every corner of my kid&#8217;s life, but sometimes it just gets to me that he left me here to do things on my own. He doesn&#8217;t understand, and he&#8217;ll never be able to understand. I just have to accept it and move on.<span id="more-636"></span></p>
<p>So&#8230; let&#8217;s see. What has happened?<br />
Three had 80&#8217;s day at school. I had a great time dressing him up!<br />
The boys had a very fun teen activity. It was a scavenger hunt meets obstacle course type of thing.<br />
We (One, Two, Three and Dragonfly) went to a haunted house! It was Three&#8217;s first time. We had a blast and Three did GREAT!<br />
Two and I went to Milwaukee to pick up a shell for pieces for his Eagle Tallon.<br />
We then all went to the LaCrosse speedway so that he could race it.<br />
I&#8217;ve been working on moving the wall in the living room. One hung my drywall for me. I&#8217;ll have to get some pictures up of that.<br />
Three got his school pictures. He&#8217;s growing SO BIG!!</p>
<p>Also, today I finished the bench I&#8217;ve been working on. Three was home from school because of his hip and heal pain again, so he helped finish it and paint.<br />
The pictures of that are HERE.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Someone recently commented to me that they heard Cede describe our last moments condensed down to me throwing a bag at him. I wonder why he fixates on a bag? I had just spent hours in the kitchen, sitting with him, crying and begging him not to leave. When there was nothing left to say and he assured me that NO MATTER what I DID or SAID would change his mind, I softly recoiled. I remember going downstairs to see what the boys were doing. My face was still full of tears and I could feel that my cheeks were warm. After a few minutes, I came upstairs to see what Cede was doing. He had all his clothes pulled out of the drawers where I had neatly put them, and they were in stacks on our bed. He had one bag that he was putting clothes into, but there were many more clothes. I was broken. I was defeated. I didn&#8217;t know what to do. I sat down on the edge of the bed to see if he would look me in my eyes one more time, but he was focused on packing.<span id="more-634"></span> When he fit all that he could in the bag, he had he paused. Thinking that I would be kind, that I would show him that even in the midst of our lives falling apart, I still loved him. I went to our closet and emptied out a bag that I had bought to hold all my yard for crocheting. I had bought it just a few weeks ago at Salvation Army. I pulled the bag out of the closet. &#8220;Here, you can use this.&#8221; I said with such a soft voice, I wondered if he heard my words at all. He took it from my hands and started shoving the rest of his clothes in it. The fact that he didn&#8217;t stop packing broke whatever pieces of my heart that were still left. I couldn&#8217;t stop crying as I walked through the kitchen and quickly went downstairs. One and Two were playing on their computers as if nothing was going on. Three saw my face and went upstairs. After I heard the back door shut, I went upstairs to see if he really left. Three was laying on his bed sobbing. I crawled onto his bed with him and tried not to cry myself. That moment was the beginning of the last 2 and 1/2 years of the 4 of us living without him.</p>
<p>But why is he so concerned about a bag? If I had NOT given him that bag, I&#8217;m sure he would have grabbed something else to put his clothes in. Why is my last moment of kindness towards him remembered that I threw a bag at him? I wasn&#8217;t mad. I wasn&#8217;t yelling. I was crushed, defeated, somber and numb. And even IF I had thrown the bag at him, or shoved it at him or tossed &#8211; why does a bag matter? He had already decided that he WAS NOT staying&#8230;. I had just spent hours begging him not to go. If there was any possible thing that I could have done, I would have done ANYTHING. If there was anything to say that could change his mind, believe me, I said it. Why is he so bothered by a bag?<br />
I guess I have my memories that are stuck into my brain, but the one that is the most vivid, is that he packed all his sports things and not ONE memento or picture of his 3 children. At that moment, I knew what his priorities were. And those priorities have continued to be evident in the time he&#8217;s been gone. I feel my children grasping onto anything that he&#8217;s willing to give, but after such a long time and no effort on his part, they are calmly settling into a new life&#8230;. a new life completely without him.</p>
