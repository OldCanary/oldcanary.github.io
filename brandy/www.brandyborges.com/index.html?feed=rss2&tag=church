				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday after school, 3 boys showed up. One was a friend that Three went trick or treating with and the other 2 were new. Three had asked that morning whether his friend (we&#8217;ll call him Brandon) could stay the night. I said sure. None of these 3 were Brandon.<br />
After an hour or so, the one mother of the child I knew came over personally and made sure that he was welcome there. She also made arrangements to pick him up at a certain time the next day. We chatted for a while, I showed her some recent things (that will become other blog posts), and she left.<br />
The other 2 boys, said that they checked it with parents and yes they could stay.<br />
So, I fed the 4 boys a snack, then dinner, then breakfast the next morning and then lunch. I was in the middle of throwing something together for tomorrow&#8217;s pot luck at church when the mother came to collect her son. We chatted again and then she left.<br />
Three said that the other 2 wanted to spend another night. I told him that we have church in the morning. He said they want to come.<br />
So I fed them a snack, I just fed them dinner again and now they&#8217;re starting to settle down and make their beds on cushionsÂ and the air mattress. They&#8217;ve been playing great all day.<br />
The thing that surprises me, is that I don&#8217;t know these other 2 boys&#8230; well, before yesterday. I haven&#8217;t met any of their parents. I haven&#8217;t even talked on the phone with them. When I suggested they run home quick and pick up some fresh clothes, they did. I was thinking that if it wasn&#8217;t ok for them to spend another night, when they popped home, their parents would notice.<br />
I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m old fashioned, but before my child goes somewhere, I meet the parents, I see for myself where he is going and all the details are discussed. I kinda feel bad for these boys. I wonder if they WANT to go home?<br />
So I&#8217;ll have 4 boys to take to church tomorrow. (One is away fixing a car making some needed money). They seem like good kids. I never know how God will use me to reach people. These boys will go to church for the first time tomorrow. We&#8217;ll see how it goes.</p>
