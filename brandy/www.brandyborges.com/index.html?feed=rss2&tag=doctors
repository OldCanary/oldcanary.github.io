				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I didn&#8217;t feel like talking to people and going into explaining EVERYTHING that was going on. I stopped posting on FB, I stopped writing in here. I pretty much just withdrew.<br />
I&#8217;m allowed to do what I want. I&#8217;m allowed to be annoyed by people.</p>
<p>Everyone has things happen in their life that they cannot control. Everyone gets pissed, frustrated and fed-up. I&#8217;ll go back and fill in a few things.</p>
<p>Christmas was hard. For starters, I had no tree. I<em> LOVE</em> having a Christmas tree; I love putting up lights and stockings and I love sending Christmas cards. None of that happened this year. It was just beyond my control. Then, I asked not to be put in the same room as Mr. Right for the holidays. I asked for people to stand up for me and tell Mr. Right that he was wrong. I would imagine this would be a simple request since he thinks he&#8217;s a doctor and without knowing my symptoms, medication and details, he has told me that I am completely healthy and have nothing wrong with me. (and my kids didn&#8217;t inherit  my genetic syndrome either). It&#8217;s so funny how I duped the SSI system of the government &#8211; as if I can fake geneticists reports, doctors notes, blood-work and MRI results.<br />
So I just didn&#8217;t want to be next to someone who is an idiot. (&#8220;Idiot: <span class="oneClick-link">an</span> <span class="oneClick-link oneClick-available">utterly</span> <span class="oneClick-link oneClick-available">foolish</span> <span class="oneClick-link">or</span> <span class="oneClick-link oneClick-available">senseless</span> <span class="oneClick-link oneClick-available">person.&#8221;) Who could blame me? So there was no Christmas. It was a wonderful display of who is actually in my corner.</span></p>
<p><span class="oneClick-link oneClick-available">Then, I had my birthday. It&#8217;s really hard being 42 and having to live the life of a 79 yr old. I use a cane, I drive a motorized cart in Walmart. Do you know how hard it is to drive past old people shopping that are walking and lifting their groceries when I am half their age and cannot walk to the back of the store or lift a gallon of milk.</span></p>
<p>Then&#8230; just a few weeks ago I lost the ability to open a can with a can opener. On the EDS support groups, it&#8217;s a line that&#8217;s drawn in the sand. Well, I&#8217;m past the line and I now own a shiny, electric can opener.</p>
<p>Then, I started getting huge &#8220;loss of concentration&#8221; times. It&#8217;s hard enough being in bed 98% and not being able to read because my eyes feel the need to go crazy.<br />
I won&#8217;t go into details, but the last straw on the list was backing into a parking spot that already contained a car. I was going slow and did no damage, but how could I not have seen a whole car? I was feeling SO independent being able to drive for 10 to 15 minutes by myself and now I have nothing. I made the decision to not drive (at least until these episodes end) and my boys have had to pick up the 1 to 2 times a week that I did drive.</p>
<p>Then, I found out that I HAVE to see my doctor in Monroe, WI before he&#8217;ll prescribe me any more meds. He&#8217;s out of my HMO. I don&#8217;t have $400 to drop in cash for an appointment and my social worker refused to authorize the appointment. So now I&#8217;m in bed 100% of the time because I have <strong>no</strong> pain relief.</p>
<p>Then, the doctor that I saw to discuss my confusion (who had never met me before) told me that I&#8217;m depressed and that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m having these episodes. I told her that just because I have things in my life that I cannot control does not make me run off a cliff to end my life. Of course I have stress. Of course I have pain, health problems, money problems and I&#8217;m raising 3 kids on my own. That doesn&#8217;t mean I need to add another medication. Ask my boys, ask my church family, ask the friends I talk to on a daily basis&#8230;. they&#8217;ll tell you. So if I take depression meds, how would that change anything? Then I&#8217;ll be happy and thrilled to spend my life in bed?</p>
<p>I am so sick and tired of being labeled. I&#8217;m so tired of people asking me if I&#8217;m depressed. Go talk to my counselor that I see 2 x a month. I tell him everything. He&#8217;ll tell you I&#8217;m just fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;m done with my rant. I feel better &lt; sigh &gt;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The balance between pain and pain meds is exhaustively hard. I&#8217;ve been through quite a journey of medication. My doctor that I have been seeing for almost 10 years now was wonderful in trying new things and sympathizing my pain. He&#8217;s the only doctor [PERIOD] that has ever <em>really</em> listened to me, believed me and acted. Together, we have solved so many of my symptoms.<br />
So why is it SO hard to find another doctor like him? I&#8217;m 3 hours away now, and my insurance doesn&#8217;t cover him, so it&#8217;s logical that I find someone closer. When I lived in Watertown, I was lucky enough to get an expert, a Physiatrist (I had never heard of the title before I met him) to prescribe my medication. But now that I&#8217;ve moved here, it seems no one agrees with the doctors who know me best, or ones who are experts on what I have. <span id="more-639"></span>The doctors in this town are hell-bent on either cutting my medicine or reducing it drastically. I went along with the first doctor that I had and she cut my long-term med in half, and then gave me NO break-through pain med. That was an extremely fun 3 months that I spent in bed. I begged and cried and wailed for my meds back &#8211; not MORE, just what I had before. When she finally admitted that she just didn&#8217;t know about my condition and wasn&#8217;t comfortable with it, I drove the 3 hours and went back to my former doctor and asked him to give me just what I was getting before and before I was even done with the question, he told me he would be glad to.<br />
Now I have this new doctor. She seemed like she was listening, understanding and knowledgeable. After seeing her a few times, I asked if it would be a possibility that she take over my medications. She said, why sure&#8230;. no problem. So I showed her my list of my medications that I printed, showing everything over the last 2 years. She nodded, smiled and went to talk to her supervising doctor. They came back in together and were chipper and smiling. They decided that I need to cut my meds in half. They talked of weaning me off pain meds entirely, but I shouldn&#8217;t worry, they won&#8217;t let me be in pain. That&#8217;s all I had to hear. I turned off everything at that point. What part of, I dislocate my joints on an daily basis and I&#8217;m in pain when I walk or sit or try to do ANYTHING, don&#8217;t they understand? I lay in bed and am in pain. They never asked me how much pain I was in on a daily basis; they never asked me how many alternative ways I try to control my pain before turning to meds; they never asked me about last year when my other doctor cut my meds in half. I sat in the quiet room after they left. A nurse was going to come in and have me sign my pain contract. It was a good 15 minutes before she finally came in. But in those minutes to myself I started shaking, I started crying. I could feel my chest getting tight. The room felt as if it was closing in on me. I can&#8217;t do it. There is no way I can put my pain in the hands of people who didn&#8217;t even care to ask me any questions about my pain. I couldn&#8217;t sign that contract.<br />
When the nurse came in and saw me crying, I tried to explain it to her. She repeated back &#8220;Oh, so you feel you weren&#8217;t heard.&#8221; That&#8217;s the tip of the iceberg. She handed me some Kleenex and she said that I am free to go.<br />
I requested that the doctor 3 hours away be covered for my insurance. All I can do is pray, because if that doesn&#8217;t work, I&#8217;ll be in bed permanently.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The last few weeks since I&#8217;ve stopped taking my nerve med has been increasingly painful. I&#8217;ve been waking up early in the mornings (3 and 4 am) with so much pain that I can&#8217;t get back to sleep. I can take extra &#8220;breakthrough pain&#8221; meds, but I don&#8217;t like taking them every day. I&#8217;ve not been able to be as active. Even standing long enough to wash a few dishes is unbearable. My hair has stopped falling out, my eyes have stopped &#8220;wiggling&#8221; and my concentration is <em>A LOT</em> better, but I feel like I&#8217;ve been hit by a truck. The main areas of pain are my back, hips and knees. My hips hurt so badly yesterday trying to walk at church. They usually always dislocate during the night (and I pop them back in), but my normal pain meds allow me to walk up to 10 minutes. I&#8217;m not even sure what to do&#8230; I hope that when I see my doc next week she&#8217;ll have a solution. I can&#8217;t keep going on like this. It doesn&#8217;t seem like a fair trade, although I&#8217;m NOT going to take the med again&#8230; I&#8217;m too afraid of losing more of my hearing.</p>

I don&#8217;t have any bones sticking out of me and I don&#8217;t have a &#8220;syndrome look&#8221; like down&#8217;s syndrome or any other disease. I look healthy and happy and young and rested. I have family and friends and a Cede that still swear that I&#8217;m not sick, not in pain and have nothing wrong with me. I do have medical records and a geneticist on my side to prove them wrong though&#8230; so you&#8217;d think they&#8217;d come around.<br />
Why do I still feel that I need the validation of certain people? Why must I convince them? What is so important in making them believe? And when and if I finally get them to believe, what have I accomplished? If they didn&#8217;t believe me when I simply told them, then they are not people that I should not hold close anyway.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am finding that I have a love / hate relationship with certain doctors. As I look through the list of doctors that I see, and that I have to see, there is one doctor that I LOVE&#8230; Dr. Davidson. He is the one doctor that, no matter what, believes me and trusts me. He is the doctor I could go to and know that he would listen to every word I said and then address each concern. The others, I need to see them, but no one else really seems to care.<br />
Today I went to see a new primary care doctor since (let&#8217;s call the previous doctor:) Dr. Canine requested I find another doctor to take over my care since they did not feel comfortable with caring for a patient with my syndrome. I had a few concerns that I brought up. He made his notes, talked a little and then examined me for a minute. He talked for a moment about what I brought up and something to try for one issue and told me to stop at the lab to have my blood drawn before I left. The thing that bothered me was that he was so &#8230; flat. It felt like I was bothering him or that he was annoyed. Maybe that&#8217;s just his personality.</p>
<p>Maybe he was just having a bad day.</p>

<p>Today I am stronger.</p>
