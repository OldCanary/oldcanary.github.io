				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the house<br />
Not a screen was illumined, no keyboards or mouse.<br />
The stockings and lights are still packed away<br />
No one had money to fund a display.<br />
The children are gone in their cars as they went<br />
My dreams were disrupted [so fast as they spent] [by D and B]<br />
As they left me alone all snuggled in bed<br />
They made enough noise to wake up the dead.<br />
When up on the roof I heard such a clatter,<br />
It&#8217;s only the squirrels, they&#8217;ve gotten much fatter.<br />
The moon has stopped shining sixteen hours ago,<br />
For I stayed up late with my laptop aglow.<br />
There wasn&#8217;t a reason to wake up on time.<br />
No presents were wrapped, I haven&#8217;t a dime.<br />
The cats thought the day should be special indeed,<br />
They left me some puke, &#8220;Oh that&#8217;s what I need!&#8221;<br />
I went back to bed, and Zero came with.<br />
And all day we sat, the whole twenty-fifth.<br />
So all of you people on facebook I see<br />
With your happy kids smiling and such lovely trees,<br />
I&#8217;m here all alone with no one in sight,<br />
I may as well go to bed for the night.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Zero has become very comfortable staying in the yard with his invisible fence. He knows his boundaries and if he&#8217;s unsure, he listens for the warning beeps and backs away to avoid the zap. This morning when I took him out, he seemed to want to spend some time relaxing out there, so I just walked back inside without him noticing. I actually forgot that he was out there for a good hour and when I went to check on him, he was laying in the sun chewing on a stick. He came to greet me and then went back to what he was doing.<br />
He&#8217;s becoming quite the little personality. I brought him a chewie and put a large bowl of water inside the garage and showed him where it was. He&#8217;s been out there almost all day now. I think he loves the independence.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My first check finally came from SSI. I feel free and relaxed and finally ready to take the next step of my life.<br />
The first check was a double check and I was able to pay all my back utilities up to date. It was such a good feeling! I will never again have to worry about having a phone, electricity or gas shut off on my kids. We will always have a roof over our heads. I still remember reaching out to Cede when we had no money and nowhere to go and a shelter was our only option and I told him that we would be moving into the local homeless shelter. He simply said, &#8220;Ok, then. Let me know what the address is.&#8221;<br />
I bought each of my boys a NICE pair of shoes. They got new socks. Three got some new outfits (from an up-scale resale shop) instead of hand-me-downs. We had the most fun at Walmart. We got paper towels, shampoo, paper plates and Zero got two toys. It is just things that we usually don&#8217;t have money for. Zero has an appointment to get his shots and to get fixed.<br />
I&#8217;m calling tomorrow to have my parents get an appointment to get their money for the back pay. I&#8217;m most excited for that. I think most of all I can&#8217;t wait for my parents to get their money back into my dad&#8217;s 401k account. Then people can shut their mouths.</p>
<p>My next call will be to a divorce attorney. Let the fun begin. Oh will that be an adventure&#8230;.. oh my, yes!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Things with Zero (point three) are going so well! He&#8217;s sure to tell me when he needs to go outside &#8211; and a few times when he just wants to meander and waste time and smell. He thought it was the coolest thing when I understood what he was trying to tell me. Of course, I was excited too. He also tells me when he&#8217;d like to work on &#8220;tricks&#8221; also. I couldn&#8217;t figure it out at first, he would lead me to the kitchen instead of the door and would sit and give a single bark. The kitchen is where I usually work on his tricks and he was telling me he&#8217;d like to perform his tricks to get some treats and a speak on command is one of his tricks. We have come, sit, lay down, give me paw (working on differentiate of left and right) and speak down and next is roll over and come/go to where I point. Samuel (our previous Australian Shepherd) was VERY smart, but not even anywhere this smart at this young.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited to see how far little Zero goes!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Zero is quite the fast learner. Today marks 4 days of no potty accidents in the house. We&#8217;ve had him exactly 3 weeks. Some dogs take MONTHS to learn that, so I&#8217;m pretty happy with his progress. Also, so far he knows: sit, down (lay down), paw (he puts his paw into your hand), and speak (he barks). He knows that he can chase and play with Grage, who initiates play and loves being chased through the house. He also knows that he&#8217;s not allowed to bother Wookie, although sometimes he is a bit mischievous and will nudge him a little to get a whine out of him. They all lay together on my bed. Wookie will usually tolerate Zero laying near or up against him and sometimes not, but to be on the same bed asleep shows trust and that makes me happy that the household of animals is happily getting along.<br />
I have been doing most all of the puppy care, but I expected to be doing it. It gets me up and out of bed and in charge of something. Zero is quite the little companion. He&#8217;s turning into a momma&#8217;s boy and my original idea to have him as a service animal is very much a reality seeing he&#8217;s picking up commands so quickly.</p>

And in following of tradition of our strange names of pets, we finally picked a name that all 3 of us liked.</p>
<p>0.3 &#8211; as in Zero Point Three (And we&#8217;ll be calling him Zero)</p>
<div class="text_exposed_show">
<p>Yes, we are all strange and weird. Here are a sampling of what we didn&#8217;t choose: Lokie, Toby, Parker, Rocky, Milo and Boo Radley.<br />
So we are now calling him Zero &#8211; he is doing great with potty training and I&#8217;ve started &#8220;come.&#8221; Today&#8217;s achievement was going down the porch stairs by himself.<br />
He&#8217;s becoming quite a little charmer. He&#8217;s running and jumping and diving around the house and yard. I think he&#8217;s growing bigger already.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our little puppy, currently still unnamed, is becoming quite a mama&#8217;s boy. He insists on sleeping on my bed right next to me at night and if he naps during the day, he either tries to get a boost up onto my bed, or if no one is around, he&#8217;ll lay on my floor at the bottom of my bed. He stares at me when he needs to go outside to go potty as if I can read his mind.<br />
He&#8217;s doing quite well with potty training though. There are fewer and fewer accidents each day and he&#8217;s learning what he&#8217;s allowed to chew on what he is to leave alone.<br />
He got quite a big personality. Now if we could just decide on a name&#8230;</p>

We knew we wanted an Australian Shepherd because we really liked our dog, Samuel, but buying one at $1000 was not an option. Last Wednesday I found an ad in a local paper that had Aussies for sale in our price range (even cheaper than the rescues were asking) so Tyler and I went to go look at them. They were healthy and beautiful and their mom was very friendly and had a great temperament. We had to pass the idea past Brent since he would be the one paying for it and when we returned the next day, Brent fell in love with them too. We picked the one that had cuddled up into Tyler&#8217;s arms the night before and we now have ourselves a brand new puppy. He doesn&#8217;t have a name yet, but he&#8217;s been doing great with potty training.</p>
