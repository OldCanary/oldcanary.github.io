	<p>People ask me why I don't just wear a mask.</p>
	<p>There are a few reasons for this:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>I am larger than most of the population and finding a mask to fit properly is difficult</li>
			<li>Masks are not effective for prolonged exposure from personal experience as well as per <a href="http://thetruthaboutmcs.blogspot.com/2007/07/study-says-carbon-filters-ineffective.html" target="_blank">this study.</a> </li>
			<li>Masks can provide their own irritations. I currently use the 3M 8247 since it fits when driving and filling my vehicle and find that I get a burning sensation in the area the mask covers due to the material it is made from.</li>
			<li>The government is suspicious of people who run around wearing full hazmat suits and a space suit would be too bulky.</li>
