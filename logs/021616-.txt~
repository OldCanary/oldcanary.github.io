We had a meeting this morning. I don't remember what was said exactly but I do remember I haven't had that much pain since the last time I went to church.
My arms went numb for a while and I wasn't sure if I could move them with any degree of control and then they started to quiver and then the muscle and joint pain took over.
It all finally settled in my whole face hurtiing and the heavy pressure feeling in the sinus cavity. I wanted to sleep for around 6 hours and it took around 10 minutes to move normally again after the meeting ended.

I need to remember to change my mask. On the drive in I got tightness in the neck. Swelling in the arms. 
After I got into the office I experienced numb spots on my scalp and face and my right arm started aching.
The headache that starts at the base of the neck has kicked in and my ears are starting to ring. It's going to be a long day.
I feel out of it as well. As if I have the flu and the feeling is increasing as I sit here.

Resistance is low this morning and the drive in was not terribly painful since it is warmer. I also missed a lot of traffic so was only about 12 min coming in.

The tea is helping with the head pain. Ears are down to blunt poking level and legs stopped hurting. Tea helped the glandular swelling reduce to merely uncomfortable levels. Some strength is returning to my arms.
