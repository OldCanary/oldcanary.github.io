		<h2>Hello, my name is Scott and I am chemically injured.</h2>
			<p>I would love to accept your invitation and join you, but I ask that you read this first and consider if you can accommodate my chemical injury.</p>
			<p>Ever see the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0258470/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1" target="_blank">Bubble Boy</a>? The beginning of that movie is a lot like what my life has become due to my chemical injury. While I don&#39;t need a hamster ball to survive, my body can no longer deal with the <a  href="http://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms?cdrid=687391" target="_blank">toxicants</a> found in everyday life. </p>
			<p>This condition is called <a href="http://www.ei-resource.org/illness-information/environmental-illnesses/multiple-chemical-sensitivity/" target="_blank">MCS/EI</a> or <a href="http://drclaudiamiller.com/about-tilt/" target="_blank">TILT</a> and it impacts where I can go, who I can be around, and how I must take care of myself.</p>
			<p>It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t enjoy the company of others, but the chemicals that are in most American products make me ill. The chemicals used in clothes and personal products make me feel like I have the flu, and the more people there are around me, the worse it gets. <a href="http://peggymunson.com/mcs/myths.html" target="_blank">Here&#39;s a helpful link</a> if you want to know more.)</p>
			<p>Chemicals in clothes and personal products? Yes. It&#39;s amazing.</p>
			<p>Laundry detergent and fabric softeners often have scents (chemicals) that are designed to make the clothes smell fresh for a long time. Then there&#39;s cologne, perfume, scented soaps, lotions, not to mention air fresheners and candles. The list goes on and on, and I can give you more information if you want it. All of them have a negative impact on my quality of life.</p>
			<p>Being around any of these chemicals, in even small amounts, will give me a headache. Literally.</p>
			<p>And that&#39;s only the start. Fogginess of mind, forgetfulness, fatigue. The presence of these chemicals can even make my joints ache.</p>
			<p>Higher concentrations are much worse. Nausea, burning eyes, tunnel vision, irregular heart rhythm. Sometimes, I can&#39;t even talk because I am unable to form words.</p>
			<p>It all depends on the concentration of the chemicals present and how long I&#39;m exposed to them.</p>
			<p>I also have to be very careful around petroleum products. Gas, oil, and exhaust from engines. New building materials like paint, flooring, plastics, and wood products made with binders. It&#39;s amazing how many petrochemicals are a part of our lives.</p>
			<p>I would like to spend time with you, but I need to make sure that I can do so without hurting.</p>

			<p>I do still enjoy photography even though I don&#39;t feel up to it as often as I would like due to my chemical injury. You can see some of my work on <a href=https://flic.kr/ps/CJn8q target="_blank">my Flikr page</a>.</p>
