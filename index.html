        		<h3>Hello, my name is Scott and I am chemically injured.</h3>
        		<li><a href="mailto:oldcanary15@gmail.com">email</a></li>
				<p>I realize that most people don't know what that means. Basically my body no longer effectively breaks down the <a href=http://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms?cdrid=687391 target="_blank">toxicants</a> found in everyday life. My injury is generally known as <a href=http://www.ei-resource.org/illness-information/environmental-illnesses/multiple-chemical-sensitivity/  target="_blank">MCS/EI</a> or <a href=http://drclaudiamiller.com/about-tilt/ target="_blank">TILT</a> and it impacts every aspect of my life from where I can go to who I can be around.</p>
				<p>Just mild exposure to synthetic fragrances like those found in perfumes, colognes, scented soaps, lotions, cleaners, scented candles, air freshers, detergents and fabric softeners impacts my quality of life in a very negative way.</p>
				<p>I also have to be careful around petroleum products such as gas, oil, and exhaust as well as new building materials like paint, flooring, plastics, and wood products made with binders. Most people are unaware of the pervasiveness of petrochemicals in our lives.</p>
				<p>It's not that I don't enjoy the company of others but the chemicals that are in most of the products used daily by the majority of Americans actually make me ill. They are used in our clothing and personal products and are designed to linger for long periods of time. When I get around people that fragrance you may enjoy may make me feel like I have the flu and the more people there are the worse it gets. Many buildings do not have adequate airflow to offset the concentrations of chemicals so places like churches, malls, theatres, or any gathering of people in a limited airspace is injurious to me.</p>
				<p>Being subjected to even small amounts of these products will produce in me at least a headache and commonly results in fogginess of mind, forgetfulness, inflamed glands and joints, as well as fatigue. In higher concentrations they have caused the inability to form words, irregular heart rhythm, nausea, tunnel vision, and burning eyes depending on the concentrations and the chemicals present.</p> 
				<p>I would love to join you for whatever you are doing but I ask you to read <a href="http://peggymunson.com/mcs/myths.html" target="_blank">this</a> first and consider carefully if you are willing to accommodate my needs before asking.</p>
				<p>If you would like to help me take a <a href=http://www.thinkbeforeyoustink.com/otherwaysyoucanhelp.html target="_blank">look here</a> for ideas.</p>
				
			<p>I still enjoy <a href=https://flic.kr/ps/CJn8q target="_blank">photography</a> even though I don't feel up to it as often as I would like.</p>
			<p>Feel free to <a href="mailto:oldcanary15@gmail.com">email</a> me with any questions.</p>
